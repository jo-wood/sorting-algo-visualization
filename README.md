# Sorting Algorithim Visualization

One of my first repos demonstrating x, y, z.... 

uses HTML, CSS, JS

- this repo has no 3rd party dependencies 

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:mgibby91/sorting-algo-visualization.git
```

Open html file with brower (ie: Open With > Chrome)

Pick the number of bars to sort, and the speed at which you want them sorted.

Then choose a sorting method and watch how the bars move from this state:

![Unsorted Bars](./docs/unsorted_blue_bars.png?raw=true)

To this final state for all sorting methods!:
